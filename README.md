## :zap: About

This is a simple project made with NextJs and it is a simplified app with core functionalities of MELI.

The project was done in NextJs to allow the generation of the static page on the server-side to solve SEO issues. The requests to the MELI API are done on the server-side too and the main pages have meta tags to help on that too.

Some static words used in the website like placeholders and others are using a function "translate", if I had access to a translation engine it could be easily changed.

### Functional description of the application

- In the search bar view, you must be able to access the product you are looking for and, when sending the
  form, navigate to the search view, viewing only 4 products. Then, at
  by clicking on one of them, you must navigate to the product's detail view.
- Given a product ID, you should be able to directly access the product detail view

### Deliverable:

- Source code in a private GitHub repository. Add user ITMLB as
  contributor;
- Unit testing and quality integration;
- Documentation where necessary;
- Instructions on how to run the project
